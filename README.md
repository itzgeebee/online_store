# An eCommerce Website built with Flask
Hosted on Heroku at https://gadgehaven.herokuapp.com/
## GadgeHaven

Gadgehaven is an eCommerce web application for gadgets like Laptops and Phones.
This project was inspired by a project on my python hero to mastery course by Angela Yu.
The project was supposed to be a simple online store with a payment system. I intended to go
simple, but I decided to challenge myself and implement a fairly complicated eCommerce site.
I am happy I made this decision because I was able to learn a lot in the process.
